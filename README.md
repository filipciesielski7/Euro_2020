## About

The main goal of this project was to implement a responsive website using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) with BEM methodology. The generated website provides information about individual national teams participating in UEFA Euro 2020 (2021), based on user choice. Final group stage table and all results of the specific team can be found on subpages after clicking on one of the 24 national flags. These can also be filtered by a search input with autocomplete feature.
